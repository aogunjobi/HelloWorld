# Project Overview

This repository contains three Jupyter Notebooks focused on data processing, filtering, and computational modeling using first-principles calculations for the discovery of new materials (in this case complex oxides). However the methods employed in these notebooks can adapted for any material of interest. Below is a summary of each notebook and its main components.

## Notebooks Summary
